Codebase Intro

<h4> I've followed micro-service orientation in building this project; where I've created backend/frontend seperate. Entire project logic is pretty much built on javascript/redux and google place API data is intereacting through django rest framework in python.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/biplovdahal/civil_maps
I've created two seperate branches for frontend/backend. Switch accordingly.(Both have their respective README.md)
Ex:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/biplovdahal/civil_maps
$ git checkout backend
$ git checkout frontend

```
