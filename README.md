Codebase Bioplerate
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/biplovdahal/civil_maps
I've created two seperate branches for frontend/backend. Switch accordingly.(Both have their respective README.md)
Ex:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/biplovdahal/civil_maps
$ git checkout backend
$ git checkout frontend

```
